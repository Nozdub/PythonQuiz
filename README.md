# **PythonQuiz**

## **Project Description**
  A private Python project I started before the fall school term of 2022 began. Wanted to use it to keep my programming skills within Python up to date.
  
  The goal with the project was to make a quiz application that would utilize several core functions within Python. In our case it would utilize writing and reading
  to file, dictionaries, if statements and loops.
  
  When I originally started this project I had good progress for the first couple of days, only working a few hours on it. I however reached a hurdle when I wanted
  to avoid having a question being picked twice. After spending a good night on trying to find solutions I ended up making a post on Stackoverflow where I got a 
  couple of insightful answers that helped me achieve my goal.
  
  As this is a WiP I'm still not complete, so the next stage will be creating a GUI.


## **How to Use the Project**
   The project should run easily enough, either through the console or through the future GUI.


## **Credits**
I want to thank Quamrana and Nathaniel Ford on Stackoverflow for helping me solve the randomisation issue.
